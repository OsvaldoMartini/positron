# Content Distribution

When an editor publishes content in Writer, it gets distributed across the web. In this doc, we break down the distribution of this content.

## [Artsy.net](https://www.artsy.net/articles)

We publish all of our content on [Artsy.net](https://www.artsy.net/articles). Each piece of content belongs to a Channel which helps us decide how an article should look.

>##### Aside on Channels
> We typically think of Channels as groups of people. A [Channel](https://github.com/artsy/positron/blob/master/api/apps/channels/model.coffee) contains some metadata and an array of Users. Users can be in multiple Channels. Depending on which Channel you're writing articles in, you'll see different layout options and administrative settings. A long time ago, we only had Users and our entire Artsy Editorial staff had to use a single login.

Because we have multiple channels, each piece of content on the site gets treated differently depending on which channel it belongs to. For example, we have [promoted content](https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-school-s-out-for-the-summer-paul-winstanley-s-spare-portraits-of-empty-art-schools) written by Artsy staff, [partner-written articles](https://www.artsy.net/waterhouse-and-dodd/article/waterhouse-dodd-interview-juliette-losq), and [Life at Artsy](https://www.artsy.net/article/daniel-doubrovkine-what-do-software-engineers-do) posts which all have different visual treatments.

In [Force](https://github.com/artsy/force), we've separated the main article body rendering to a component. This helps us embed articles anywhere on the site, like on a [fair article](https://www.artsy.net/the-armory-show-2017/info/about-the-fair) or [artist bio]().


Bored? Here are some great Artsy Editorial (Channel) articles:
- [Are Video Games Art?](https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-are-video-games-art)
- [What Happens If You Break an Artwork?](https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-break-artwork)
- [GIPHY Is Helping Get Artists’ Works Viewed 100 Million Times](https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-giphy-artists-works-viewed-100-million-times)
- [What Makes "Bad" Art Good?](https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-bad-art-good)

Articles are responsive, so we look good everywhere:

Speaking of Facebook...

## Facebook Instant Articles (FBIA)

We use the [Instant Articles API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instant-articles/api) to send new articles and updates to Facebook. On every published article save, we kick off a request to Facebook's `instant_articles` endpoint with any recent changes. You can check out the way we fire the distribution [here](https://github.com/artsy/positron/blob/master/api/apps/articles/model/distribute.coffee) in the `postFacebookAPI` method and the way we build out the content in [this directory](https://github.com/artsy/positron/tree/master/api/apps/articles/components/instant_articles).

## Email (Sailthru)

Email is quite the beast on Publishing. Similar to Facebook, we push changes to Sailthru (our ESP/marketing tool)

## Google AMP

We've been tackling [speed issues](http://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/11/02/improving-page-speed-with-graphql/) for a while on Publishing, and once we heard about [Google AMP](https://www.ampproject.org/) and it's relatively simple implementation, we were on board. The AMP distribution is pretty different from the rest.

By adhering to the AMP Project rules and using a simple `<html ⚡>` to the page, we get load times that are faster than the blink of an eye from Google Search results.

## RSS

All of our latest content (published in the last two days) can be found on our [News RSS feed](https://www.artsy.net/rss/news). This is generated by Force in a handy little Express [sub-app](https://github.com/artsy/force/tree/master/desktop/apps/rss). We currently pass this RSS feed to Apple News as well, although we're working towards using the [Apple News API](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/General/Conceptual/News_API_Ref/index.html) instead.
